# NOTE: The `endpoints` function in `common.sh` used to return ephemeral pod
# IPs, but now we have it return a fixed list of host names. Since the list of
# host names is static, we do not need nor want to add/remove new members to the
# replica set configuration as part of a pod lifecycle, therefore we comment out
# the code below.
